- Quarkus
- Metrics
- Health Check
- Separate JUnit5 project (again with Quarkus, because why not)
  - [Testing Guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing)

  - One test still fails because of unknown reasons. No idea why the date stuff doesn't work, and debugging doesn't work either. .w.



Oh, also, I'm currently trying out Git Submodules.
